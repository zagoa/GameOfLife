The application has its default parameters :
Area size : 50 cases
Population : 50% (half of field is filled by living beings with 50% of humans and 50% of animals)
Percentage of sick animals : 50%

---------- DESCRIPTION ----------
The application run the simulation of a flu epidemic with the conditions given on Moodle.
Simulation is over when every human is either healthy or dead.
We implement two variants :

 - if a human is vaccinated, he is not capable to catch the infection.
